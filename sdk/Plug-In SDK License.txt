THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. This License Agreement accompanies REAL Software's

additions, and copies of the SDK licensed to You by REAL Software. This copy 
of the SDK is licensed to You as the end user or to Your employer or 
another third party authorized to permit Your use of the SDK.

1.	DEFINITIONS. In this License Agreement, SDK means the API

items, all as delivered to you by REAL Software and included within the 
Plug-In SDK folder when installed. The Plug-In software placed on 
your computer by executing the REALbasic installer is NOT included as 
part of the SDK.  Only those items placed on your computer by 
executing the SDK installer are part of the SDK. REAL Software Products refer 
to REAL Software's application programs and software such as REALbasic 
Plug-Ins which are or may be made available for licensing to the 
general public, including any modified versions or upgrades thereof. 
API development software means that software in the API folder in 
object code format, not otherwise made available by REAL Software as a 
commercial product, that REAL Software has included for You as part of the 
SDK to distribute unmodified with Your application programs. Sample 
Code means software code that REAL Software has included for You to 
incorporate into Your application programs. Tools refer to programs 
and Utilities that may be included for You to test or compile Your 
application programs. REAL Software means REAL Software Systems Incorporated. 
Developer, You and Your refer to any person or entity acquiring or 
using the SDK under the terms of this License Agreement.

2.	ROYALTY-FREE LICENSE.  Subject to the restrictions contained 
in this Section 2, REAL Software grants to You a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the items in the SDK 
only for the purpose of internal development of application programs 
designed to function with REAL Software products.

Under this License, You may use, modify or merge all or portions of 
the Sample Code with Your application programs and distribute it only 
as part of Your products in object code form. Any modified or merged 
portion of the Sample Code is subject to this License Agreement. You 
are required to include REAL Software's copyright notices on Your application 
programs except for those programs in which You include a copyright 
notice reflecting the copyright ownership of Developer in such 
programs. You may not use REAL Software's name, logo or trademarks to market 
Your products. You may not assign Your rights or obligations granted 
under this License Agreement without the prior written consent of 
REAL Software.  Any attempted assignment or transfer without such prior 
written consent from REAL Software shall be void and of no effect.

You may use the REAL Software Products included in the SDK, if any, subject 
to End User Licenses or conditions stated on the specific REAL Software 
Product. You may use the Tools, accompanying materials or other items 
in the SDK solely for the purpose of internal development. You may 
not include REAL Software Products and Tools and accompanying materials in 
the SDK in Developers products under this License Agreement. You may 
not sell, sublicense, rent, loan or lease the REAL Software Products, Tools 
and accompanying materials in the SDK to any third party. You may not 
reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any REAL Software Products, API 
development software or Tools that are supplied to You under this 
License Agreement. To the extent that local law grants You the right 
to decompile software in order to obtain information necessary to 
render the software interoperable with other software, You shall 
first request to REAL Software in writing to provide You with the necessary 
information. REAL Software has the right to impose reasonable conditions such 
as a reasonable fee for doing so. Requests for information should be 
directed to the REAL Software at the address provided in the SDK or such 
other address made available on realsoftware.com from time to time.


You may make a limited number of copies of the SDK to be used by Your 
employees or consultants as provided herein, and not for general 
business purposes, and such employees or consultants shall be subject 
to this License Agreement.

You may use API development software only as provided in the REAL Software 
specification applicable thereto, and distribute it solely with Your 
products on the same media. You may not modify API development 
software. The API development software may be distributed to Your 
customers under the terms of Your standard End User License Agreement 
provided it includes terms which are substantially similar to those 
applicable to the API development software, as described herein.

3.	PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.  The items in the SDK are the 
intellectual property of REAL Software and its suppliers and are protected by 
United States copyright and patent law, international treaty 
provisions and applicable laws of the country in which it is being 
used. You agree to protect all copyright and other ownership 
interests of REAL Software and/or its suppliers in all items in the SDK 
supplied under this License Agreement. You agree that all copies of 
the items in the SDK, reproduced for any reason by You, contain the 
same copyright notices, and other proprietary notices as appropriate, 
as appear on or in the
master items delivered by REAL Software in the SDK. REAL Software and/or its 
suppliers retain title and ownership of the items in the SDK, the 
media on which it is recorded, and all subsequent copies, regardless 
of the form or media in or on which the original and other copies may

particular purpose or with respect to their adequacy to produce any 
particular result. REAL Software and its suppliers shall not be liable for 
loss or damage arising out of this License Agreement or from the 
distribution or use of Developers products containing portions of the 
Sample Code, API development software or from any of the other items 
in the SDK. REAL SOFTWARE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NONINFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHT IN RESPECT OF THE ITEMS IN 
THE SDK OR ANY SERVICES RELATED TO THE SDK.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation 
of incidental, consequential or special damages, or the exclusion of 
implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may 
last, so the above limitations may not apply to You. You may have 
rights which vary from state to state or jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction. The foregoing does not affect or prejudice Your 
statutory rights. To the extent permissible any implied warranties 
are limited to ninety (90) days. For further warranty information You 
may contact REAL Software's Customer Support Department, at REAL Software 
Incorporated, PMB 220, 3300 Bee Caves Road, Suite 640, Austin, TX 78746.

REAL Software is under no obligation to provide any support under this 
License Agreement, including upgrades or future versions of Sample 
Code, API development software or other items in the SDK, to 
Developer, end user or to any other party. REAL Software is acting on behalf 
of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or 
restricting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this 
Clause 5, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.

6.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.   Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this License Agreement, REAL Software's liability to You under 
this License Agreement shall be limited to the amount paid by You for 
the SDK.

IN NO EVENT WILL REAL Software BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, 
LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS, FEES OR EXPENSES OF ANY KIND OR 
NATURE ARISING OUT OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THE 
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ITEMS IN THE SDK, EVEN IF AN REAL Software 
REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, 
OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY PARTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or special 
damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You. 
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prejudice the statutory 
rights of any party dealing as a consumer.

7.	INDEMNIFICATION.  Developer agrees to indemnify, hold 
harmless, and defend REAL Software from and against any claims or lawsuits, 
including attorneys' fees, that arise or result from the use or 
distribution of Developer's products containing Sample Code or API 
development software, provided that REAL Software gives Developer prompt 
written notice of any such claim, tenders to Developer the defense or 
settlement of such a claim at Developer's expense and cooperates with 
Developer, at Developer expense, in defending or settling such claim.

8.	CHOICE OF LAW.  This License Agreement shall be governed by 
the laws in force in the State of California in the United States, 
excluding the application of its conflict of law rules. This License 
Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on 
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of 
which is expressly excluded.

product that includes Sample Code or API development software (i) 
will include in its license agreement a reference to applicable U.S. 
Government regulations that control licensing of software, and (ii) 
will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country or used 
in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration 
Act.

shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the 
part of REAL Software, its agents or employees, but only by an instrument in 
writing signed by an officer of REAL Software.

11.	INTEGRATION.  When conflicting language exists between this 
License Agreement and any other agreement included in the SDK, this 
License Agreement shall supersede. If either REAL Software or Developer 
employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to 
this License Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to 
recover reasonable attorneys' fees. You acknowledge that You have 
read this License Agreement, understand it and that it is the 
complete and exclusive statement of Your agreement with REAL Software which 
supersedes any prior agreement, oral or written, between REAL Software and

unless REAL Software gives its express consent, in writing signed by an 
officer of REAL Software.
